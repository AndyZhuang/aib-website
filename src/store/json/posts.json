      "body": "<p>One of the great tragedies of cryptocurrencies has been the failure to\ninteroperate with one another.  Cryptocurrency platforms are competing for\ndominance with their own, largely incompatible technical roadmaps. It’s as if\neach blockchain consensus system with its own community is too sovereign for\nits own good.</p>\n<p>Mechanisms like <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_cross-chain_trading\">atomic swaps</a> between chains can\ncertainly help to link communities. However, where there are no technical\nissues, they often suffer from a need for mature liquidity markets and active\nparticipants on each side. Thus the “altcoin” ecosystem is an alchemical soup\nof enthusiasts experimenting in various ways. Many possess new designs and\nconvictions, yet often each stands alone, siloed by the lack of a general\ninter-blockchain communication system.</p>\n<p>Ethereum sought to address this problem, somewhat indirectly, by inventing a\nnew platform for computation. Ethereum allows arbitrary financial systems to be\nwritten against a common virtual machine using a common development\nenvironment. Presuming all new cryptocurrencies launch on Ethereum, they will\nhave some capacity for interoperability.</p>\n<p>Ethereum is in fact a wonderful idea. Its design decisions are motivated by\nimportant considerations such as the need for a simple specification and\nguaranteed determinism. However, it neglects elements such as the difficulty of\ndesigning a secure general purpose programming environment. This means Ethereum\nhas its own sovereignty problem, as it excludes developers who want access to\nthe platform but want alternatives to the current <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine\">state transition machine</a>.</p>\n<p>Ethereum also doesn’t address the problem of turning fiat currency into\nfungible tokens, short of having banks and government bodies issue currency on\nEthereum itself. While many institutions are investigating the Ethereum\nblockchain, there are both scalability and governance concerns which ultimately\nrestrict full-scale adoption. This may impede integration with existing systems\nand currencies.</p>\n<p>Much like communities, companies and nation-states, each existing\ncryptocurrency is born with the seed of some cultural ideal. Bitcoin is\ndecidedly libertarian, with a slight anarchist leaning. Ethereum is less a\npolitical statement and more an avant-garde academic exercise in distributed\nsystems, computer science and contract theory. Dogecoin is a testament to the\ncapacity for humans to bond over the absurd, a phenomenon more commonly known\nas “being social”. Steem offers a more structured version of this same\nbehavior, with a basis in content production and curation.</p>\n<p>And so on, down the line. But there are many more viewpoints in the world, each\ndoubtlessly wanting a unique experiment in the intersection between governance,\nculture and economics. It would be a tragedy for all these experiments to be so\nrigidly siloed from one another by great chasms of incompatibility.</p>\n<p>Clearly, what is needed is something that can integrate the states of existing\nblockchains. Something that can interface in a sane manner with everything from\nnovelty rewards points to currencies issued by nation-states. Something for\nformalizing relationships between systems, without compromising independence.\nSomething with extreme flexibility without compromising security.</p>\n<p>Enter Cosmos, the “Internet of Blockchains”. Cosmos is a network and a\nframework for interoperability between blockchains. It consists of a web of\nhubs and zones, where each zone is effectively an independent blockchain with\nan arbitrary cryptocurrency design (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZeroCash,\nCryptoNote, your local banking institution, etc.). Each hub is a multi-asset\ncryptocurrency that facilitates interoperability between some set of zones.</p>\n<p>Hubs and zones are powered by the Tendermint Proof-of-Stake (TMSP) consensus\nalgorithm, using the TMSP interface to host applications written in any\nprogramming language. TMSP permits enormous flexibility in application design\nand enables the application to inherit the security features of a\nTendermint-powered blockchain. In fact, Cosmos is compatible with any Byzantine\nFault Tolerant system, which is the basis of Tendermint itself.</p>\n<p>Zones communicate with one another through a hub, primarily in the form of\nasymmetric transfer of some set of tokens from one zone to another.\nEffectively, a hub is a blockchain with many sidechains, but using PoS instead\nof PoW leads to a dramatic reduction in overhead without sacrificing security.\nEach zone acts as a light client for the hub, and the hub acts as a light\nclient for all its zones. Tendermint makes this efficient with compact light\nclient proofs that are secure so long as the validator set is known. This can\nbe achieved by ensuring the light client synchronizes with validator set\nchanges at least as often as they are permitted to occur.</p>\n<p>Cosmos makes no distinction between hubs. There is no top hub and the most\npopular or successful hub is a matter of adoption by zones. Furthermore, there\nis no fundamental distinction between zones and hubs, such that any zone with\nsufficient functionality can become a hub. Cosmos will release one particular\nhub in order to get things started, the aptly named Adam hub. There is nothing\nstopping this hub from becoming obsolete, or stopping the likes of Bitcoin or\nEthereum from competing with it and potentially replacing it.</p>\n<p>Cosmos thus introduces a new kind of market dynamic that formalizes the\nfriction points between various cryptocurrency offerings. It demolishes\nbarriers to interoperability by enabling competition between hubs to contribute\nto the economic security of each hub itself. Validators who misbehave will be\nabandoned for better behaving ones. The result is a heterogeneous network – an\nInternet of Blockchains – adapting for each community and each locale\naccording to its needs, all while retaining a backbone of interoperability. The\ngoal is keeping barriers to entry low while holding stewards of the system\naccountable.</p>\n<p>Cosmos’ potential is building synergy and unlocking the power that exists in\nevery cryptocurrency. As operators in one particular echo chamber of consensus\nsystems design, Cosmos believes interoperability is the key to unlocking the\ncollective developments of this industry. With the Internet of Blockchains,\ncompanies and individuals can utilize the services of one chain, without\nabandoning their existing investments in another. This creates a world that is\nfairer, more functional and better secured. This is a call for an end to echo\nchambers, and the beginning of bridge-building.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>Bitcoin brought the world’s attention to the blockchain. But alas, the Bitcoin\nversion of blockchain isn’t sufficient for the world’s blockchain needs. That\nis because Bitcoin’s proof of work (PoW) consensus <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/bitcoin-could-consume-as-much-electricity-as-denmark-by-2020\">requires an enormous amounts\nof energy</a>. In addition, transactions are painstakingly slow, taking an hour or\nlonger to commit. And because PoW miners have little incentive to be loyal to\none chain or other, upgrades are difficult to coordinate.</p>\n<p>We need an approach to manage blockchains securely that does not impose a huge\nenergy cost on our planet. That approach is Byzantine fault-tolerance\n(BFT)-based <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=27787.0\">proof-of-stake</a> (PoS).  We call it BFT-PoS.</p>\n<p>Before I delve into the merits of BFT-PoS, let me first address the concept of\nByzantine faults without going into confusing detail about <a href=\"http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sschang/OS-Qual/reliability/byzantine.htm\">Lamport’s General\nand his armies</a>.</p>\n<p>In a distributed system, where data is replicated across hundreds or thousands\nof nodes, there needs to be some type of fault-tolerance or consensus\nalgorithm, for the simple fact that computers break down or go offline from\ntime to time. So if a portion of those nodes fail, the system as a whole still\nneeds to reach a consensus.</p>\n<p>Standard fault-tolerant consensus algorithms like\n<a href=\"https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf\">Raft</a> and\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a> assume that\nwhen a node fails, it simply stops working and doesn’t send back a reply.\nGoogle, Facebook, and some existing database products already use this family\nof consensus algorithms within their firewalls to ensure that services remain\navailable despite faulty computers.</p>\n<p>But these algorithms aren’t suitable for public blockchains, because there is\nno firewall in a public blockchain.  Anyone with mining power (in PoW) or\nstaking tokens (in PoS) can participate, or even try to sabotage the network.\nTo reach consensus on a public blockchain, we need Byzantine fault-tolerance.\nIn a Byzantine fault, the faulty node can behave in a completely arbitrary\nmanner. Nodes can even collude to try and maximize the damage they cause.</p>\n<p>So essentially, the purpose of a BFT consensus algorithm is to establish trust\nbetween otherwise unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the\nInternet.</p>\n<p>BFT is nothing new. The concept was first introduced in an academic paper by\n<a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf\">Lamport, Shostak, and Pease in\n1982</a>. But\nLamport et al only demonstrated the theoretical feasibility of the algorithm in\na synchronous environment, where all the messages always arrive on time.</p>\n<p>But in the real world, you can’t really trust the Internet to deliver anything\non time. So in 1988, <a href=\"http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf\">Dwork, Lynch, and Stockmeyer</a> (DLS) proposed an algorithm\nthat works in mostly asynchronous environments.  Later in 1999, <a href=\"http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf\">Miguel Castro\nand Barbara Liskov</a> proposed a practical solution for continuous BFT consensus\nthat was, and still is today, the state-of-the-art in BFT algorithms.</p>\n<p>But for a long time, the mainstream press ignored these seminal works. Nobody\nunderstood the importance of BFT outside academia and major institutions like\nIBM and DARPA, until 2009 when Bitcoin came along. Bitcoin was the first open\ndecentralized application to provide BFT consensus on a global currency ledger,\nbut using a completely novel solution to the Byzantine general’s problem: PoW.</p>\n<p>In PoW, miners compete, based on who has the most processing power, to validate\ntransactions. And for their efforts they are rewarded with transaction fees and\nnewly minted bitcoins. This is how Bitcoin creates new currency.  Bitcoin\nminers around the globe compete in a lottery-like system for these newly issued\nbitcoins, and the efficient market makes it so that the cost of the energy used\nby the global mining network is on the order of the block reward (plus\ntransaction fees).  Today, that turns out to be around $1M worth of electricity\nper day.  In addition, Bitcoin mining is being commoditized by <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1072474.0\">large data\ncenters in places of the world where electricity is more affordable</a>, making it\ndifficult for laymen to participate.</p>\n<p>PoS, on the other hand, does away with the energy dependence of PoW entirely.\nIn PoS, miners are replaced with “validators” who have a stake in the system.\nValidators don’t have to invest in expensive processing systems but they do\nhave to purchase “staking tokens.” Any normal laptop will suffice to solve the\nalgorithm.</p>\n<p>Peercoin, <a href=\"https://bitshares.org/\">BitShares</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nxt\">Nxt</a>, and others already use some form of\nPoS, and Ethereum is planning a move to PoS in the near future. Yet, while PoS\nmakes practical sense, many people have <a href=\"https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf\">rallied against the use of\nPoS</a>, claiming it is\nimpossible to secure. But that is simply not true. Using BFT, you absolutely\ncan secure PoS.  It’s just that we haven’t seen any BFT-PoS public blockchains\nyet.</p>\n<p>While the theory may be difficult to explain or understand, the ultimate\nresults provided by proper BFT algorithms are simple to grasp.  Unlike PoW\nblockchains, BFT-PoS blockchains do not fork (i.e. get double-spend attacked)\nat all unless ⅓ or more validators coordinate such an attack.  And, when 1/3 or\nmore validators do cause a double-spend attack, we can computationally\ndetermine which validators were responsible for the attack, destroy their\nstaking tokens and eject them from the network.  It’s as if the staking tokens\nare virtualized PoW miners that blow up when used to attack the system.  No\nother blockchain consensus algorithm, including PoW, can provide the level of\ncollateralization that is possible with BFT-PoS.</p>\n<p>BFT-PoS performs extremely well. Today, in global public blockchain with a few\nhundred validators, you can get transaction finality on the  order of 3\nseconds, easily – no need to wait for additional block confirmations! The\ntheory has proven to us that these are optimal fault-tolerance thresholds for\n“instant-finality” blockchains.  While more validators does slow down\nconsensus, if <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/\">Nielsen’s\nlaw</a> continues to hold,\nwe’ll even be able to support an exponentially increasing number of validators\nevery year with the same performance.</p>\n<p>In addition, BFT-PoS will also increase the security of mobile wallets. Few of\nthe mobile wallets in existence today take full advantage of the security\noffered by Bitcoin, for the simple fact that nobody is willing to wait an hour\nfor a transaction to clear. Instead, most wallets just assume that <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/peter-todd-explains-the-problems-with-unconfirmed-bitcoin-transactions\">the person\nsending the money isn’t trying to double spend\nit</a>.\nAnd, though we don’t have time to dive into it here, efficient mobile wallet\nprotocols, or “light client SPV” protocols are the key to future blockchain\ninteroperability.</p>\n<p>While PoW worked well for Bitcoin, it’s costly, slow, and environmentally\nunfriendly. The best alternative out there right now is BFT-PoS. It’s an\nenduring, energy efficient solution that works well in asynchronous\nenvironments. And best of all, because BFT was developed by the best and the\nbrightest in the computer science industry, it’s provably secure. You can’t do\nany better than that.</p>\n",
