We could not be more pleased to see that the vision for\nthe Internet of Blockchains has been slowly catching on in the community,  with\nour research and preparation solidifying nicely as well.</p>\n<p>Pertaining to the fundraiser, we have a sequence of announcements to make in\nthe coming weeks. We would love both your feedback and your assistance to\nensure that we make the fundraiser a success. Ultimately, the goal of\nconnecting the disparate blockchains and enabling moving money seamlessly\nbetween them is substantial, with a number of moving parts, each of some\ncomplexity… Your questions and comments help us to hone our communications,\nhopefully  leading to simpler, clearer explanations of all aspects of this\nCosmos that we will build together.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/blog/cosmos-roadmap\">our last post</a>, we wrote about the different components of the Cosmos Network\nand our strategic roadmap. This week we are soliciting your input and\nannouncing the first of two bounties!</p>\n<h2>Whitepaper Bounty</h2>\n<p>The Cosmos whitepaper was published last summer, and we received excellent\nquestions, comments, and general feedback about it. But this was rather\ninformal, and we did not in any way officially onboard the feedback we\nreceived. Today that changes: Before we launch the fundraiser, we want to\ninvite a public review of the whitepaper, really an open line to question our\npremises and our proposed solutions. We know that many of you will have\nbrilliant ideas that we haven’t yet heard, and we want to be certain that the\nCosmos system is not only technically and conceptually bulletproof, but\nabsolutely imbued with the best ideas, from the best minds!</p>\n<p>So of course, we are especially interested in exploring the overall Cosmos\narchitecture; those technical or economic flaws that we might have overlooked.\nBut fear not, the long hours you’ll spend wearing your well-trodden thinking\ncap, brooding over our oh-so-cosmic ideas shall not go unrewarded. For usable\ncontributions, we will give out in aggregate 5 bitcoins. We might award that\nentirely to the best and most shattering contribution, or we may perhaps split\nit out over several different ones. In addition, depending on how your review\naffects your belief in the project, you may choose to receive your reward in\neither bitcoin or in atoms!</p>\n<p>Here are the rules and process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Though any platform for discussion may be initially used, all\ncontributions must ultimately be filed formally as GitHub issues.</li>\n<li><strong>The repository for filing is <a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/issues\">https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/issues</a> and\nyou should tag @jaekwon and @ebuchman.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Please make your point as descriptive as it needs to be, but no more.  A\nsummary of the concern, followed by a more broad description, is probably\nideal.</strong></li>\n<li>The review begins today, Wednesday the 15th of February, and will run\nuntil Friday February 24th at midnight PST.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As always, if you have any questions or comments, you can find us on\n<a href=\"http://slack.cosmos.network\">Slack</a>,\n<a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/thecosmos\">Reddit</a>, and/or\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/cosmos_hq\">Twitter</a>.

      "body": "<p>In Cosmos land, we have been hard at work with getting everything ready for the\nbig fundraiser. The Internet of Blockchain meme has been slowly catching on in\nthe blockchain community and the vision has solidified in our research and\npreparation as well.</p>\n<p>We will have a sequence of announcements coming in the next weeks and we would\nlove your help and feedback to ensure that we make the fundraiser a success and\nmost importantly realize the ultimate goal of connecting the disparate\nblockchains and enabling moving money seamlessly between chains.</p>\n<p>In this post, we want to share some information about the components of the\nCosmos network and in what sequence we want to release and prioritize those\ncomponents.</p>\n<h1>Two Funding Milestones</h1>\n<p>We are dividing the different components of the Cosmos Network into two\ndifferent parts. The first part is the Cosmos Essential Software and Services.\nIt contains the minimum components needed to make sure that Cosmos works and is\nfunctional.</p>\n<p>While basic functionality is great, there is a lot to do that goes beyond that\nto realize the full vision of Cosmos. Once the basic components have been\nbuilt, we will have another set of projects and components to build to enhance\nthe usefulness, usability and connectivity of the network.</p>\n<h2>Cosmos Essential Software and Services (CESS)</h2>\n<p>CESS consists of all the software necessary to deploy a minimal network that is\ndeserving of the phrase “Internet of Blockchains”. At its heart lies the Cosmos\nHub, a complete, multi-asset, proof-of-stake blockchain with built-in\ngovernance and support for the <a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin/blob/develop/docs/guide/ibc.md\">InterBlockchain Communication (IBC) protocol</a>.\nCESS also includes zones that serve as bridges to the public Bitcoin and\nEthereum networks, as well as a <a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/DEX.md\">decentralized exchange (the Cosmos DEX)</a> and an\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/ethermint/\">Ethermint</a> zone, which runs the full Ethereum state machine on Tendermint\nconsensus.</p>\n<p>There will be five blockchains that launch with the Cosmos Network: Hub, DEX,\nBitcoin-Bridge, Ethereum-Bridge, and Ethermint.</p>\n<p>The Cosmos Hub itself is built using two key pieces: <a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint\">Tendermint</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin\">Basecoin</a>.\nTendermint is the general purpose consensus engine that will be used, at least\ninitially, for all blockchains in Cosmos; it is nearing a production-ready\nstate, and is <a href=\"https://tendermint.com/ecosystem\">already in use by many different organizations</a>. Basecoin is an\n<a href=\"https://cosmos.network/blog/cosmos-creating-interoperable-blockchains-part-1\">extendable framework</a>\nfor building multi-asset cryptocurrency applications on\nTendermint. It’s under active development and includes many working <a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin-examples\">example\nplugins</a>.\nTo build the Hub, we need Basecoin plugins for IBC that will manage\nvalidators and their stake, manage delegators and their stake, slash validators\nthat misbehave, and manage governance. These are in various states of\ndevelopment.</p>\n<p>The Bitcoin and Ethereum bridges will enable Cosmos to interoperate with the\npublic Bitcoin and Ethereum networks through the mechanism of two-way pegs,\nfamiliar to many as <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/technology/\">“sidechains”</a>. These will be sidechains of Bitcoin and\nEthereum, which will enable users to move BTC and ETH to and from the Cosmos\nNetwork. Once in the Cosmos Network, they can be transferred through the Hub to\nother zones, including the decentralized exchange. ETH can also be transferred\nto Ethermint zones, where it can be used to power applications written for the\nEVM, but running on a faster consensus algorithm such as Tendermint.</p>\n<p>Finally, CESS includes wallet software for managing funds, sending transactions\non the Cosmos Network, and participating in governance.</p>\n<p>In summary, the foundational components of the project include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint\"><strong>Tendermint</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin\"><strong>Basecoin Framework</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin\"><strong>Hub</strong> (IBC, PoS/Delegation, Governance)</a></li>\n<li><strong>Bitcoin and Ethereum bridges</strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/DEX.md\"><strong>DEX</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/ethermint\"><strong>Ethermint</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Auxiliary Software and Services</h2>\n<p>The auxiliary software and services includes tools which contribute greatly to\nthe usability, functionality, and adoption of the Cosmos Network. In\nparticular, we have identified the following elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blockchain Explorer</strong>: an advanced UI for navigating the Cosmos Network,\nincluding analyzing activity within zones, traffic across zones, the\nperformance of validators, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Fluidity Smart Contract Framework</strong>: a new programming language\nenvironment for building deterministic and halting programs that can run on a\nblockchain. The intent is to take lessons learned from the design of\nEthereum’s Solidity to provide something equally accessible, and with greater\nsupport for extensibility, testing, and safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Events and Support</strong>: funding for meetups around the world and\nparticular events, such as in (but not excluded to) San Francisco, Toronto,\nNew York, Berlin, and Seoul, where many of our developers and community are\nbased.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional Zones</strong>: examples include ZCash, Monero, Bitcoin, and\nothers. Community opinion will inform which zones we build.</li>\n<li><strong>Cosmic Grants</strong>: A program, which awards grants for projects and research\nefforts for advancing the internet of blockchain vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Development Timeline</h1>\n<p>The development timeline for Cosmos is split across five eras: Synthesis,\nAtomic Era, Galactic Era, Planetary Era, and Lunar Era.</p>\n<h2>Synthesis</h2>\n<p>Synthesis is the period in which the Hub is built. It began over two years ago\nwith the birth of the Tendermint project and continues today with the\ndevelopment of the Basecoin framework and the various plugins necessary to\ncompose the Cosmos Hub.</p>\n<h2>Atomic Era</h2>\n<p>The Atomic Era starts roughly 4 months after the completion of the fundraiser.\nIt is marked by the release of an Alpha version of the Cosmos Hub and a\ncorresponding testnet. This includes a working form of the governance,\nproof-of-stake, delegation, and IBC modules, as well as a working wallet for\nmaking transactions on the Cosmos Hub. The testnet will include a genesis state\nderived from the results of the fundraiser, enabling all who participated to\ntest the network.</p>\n<h2>Galactic Era</h2>\n<p>The Galactic Era starts roughly 8 months after the completion of the fundraiser\nand is marked by the release of the first production version of the Cosmos Hub\nand the first blockchain to be launched in the Cosmos Network. It also marks\nthe beginning of work on the Bitcoin and Ethereum bridges, as well as the DEX.\nThese zones will be iterated on as newer versions are connected to the hub.</p>\n<h2>Planetary Era</h2>\n<p>The Planetary Era starts roughly 12 months after the completion of the\nfundraiser and marks the first period of stability for the Cosmos Network,\nincluding working Bitcoin and Ethereum bridges, and a working decentralized\nexchange. At this point, the focus will shift to usability and extensive\ndocumentation to in order to help new users and developers integrating with the\nCosmos Network. Further details will be announced based on changing conditions.</p>\n<h2>Lunar Era</h2>\n<p>It is unclear when the Lunar Era starts, but it is marked by a sublime state of\nmind that results from the satisfaction of the Cosmos Network having reached\nmaturity. Similar to the feeling one would experienced when sipping a cocktail\non a beach and glancing at a coconut tree that has blossomed into its full\nbeauty after a seed planted years before.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Development on the Cosmos Essential Software and Services continues at quite a clip,\nand the road ahead is well defined and full of exciting technology.\nWe’re looking forward to building this out with the community and\nmaking the Internet of Blockchains a reality for everyone!</p>\n",

At\nthe moment we don’t know exactly how long this will take. The initial flow\nwill be finalized by Monday next week (Feb 13th), and promptly delivered to\nauditors. Soon after, we’ll make the code available for public review, and\nprovide bounties for anybody who discovers issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We <em>must</em> finalize the Cosmos roadmap. In order to finalize the roadmap, we\nare concluding negotiations with interested parties and reviewing financial\ndetails regarding the core Cosmos software. These details should be released\nby Thursday (Feb 9th) for public review.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We’ve updated our whitepaper and will be seeking feedback over the coming\ndays.

      "date": 1484611200000,
      "body": "<blockquote>\n<p>A series on <a href=\"http://cosmos.network/\">Cosmos</a>, the internet of blockchains powered by the <a href=\"http://tendermint.com/\">Tendermint</a> consensus engine. <em>View blog post on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jaekwon/cosmos-creating-interoperable-blockchains-part-1-2929435ba1fa#.kmwc5d4px\">Medium</a>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are several ways to create public blockchain applications today. The\nprimary ones are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create your own blockchain from scratch, as Satoshi Nakamoto did.</strong> This\nrequires one to two years of full-time dedicated programming to get a completed\nsystem, and should not be attempted without a very good reason.</li>\n<li><strong>Fork an existing blockchain stack like Bitcoin, as various altcoins such as\n<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core\">Namecoin</a></strong> have done.</strong> This\nworks well if the base codebase is well designed to be modular, but that’s\nrarely the case.</li>\n<li><strong>Write a “smart contract” in an on-chain interpreted language such as\n<a href=\"https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/\">Solidity</a></strong>. This is currently the\nbest option for creating simple public blockchain applications, but it requires\nlearning and debugging two levels of complexity — the virtual-machine bytecode\ninterpreter, and the smart contract language.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With <a href=\"http://tendermint.com/\">Tendermint</a> we introduced a fourth way of creating\nnew public blockchain applications (and by extension, private/consortium apps as\nwell):</p>\n<p><strong>4. Write a state-machine in any language (e.g. Golang, Python, etc), and plug\nit into Tendermint’s consensus engine.</strong> Tendermint is responsible for p2p\nnetworking, consensus, and transaction broadcasting. After nodes come to\nconsensus on a block, they push it to the state-machine via a unix-socket\nprotocol called <a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/abci\">ABCI</a> (formerly known as\nTMSP).</p>\n<p>Tendermint solves a lot of problems for blockchains, but when it comes to\n<em>public</em> blockchains, there are additional common concerns that must be\naddressed to provide availability. We must balance the desire to provide\npermissionless and censorship-resistant access with the need to prevent spam and\ndenial-of-service (DoS) attacks. While there are many solutions to this problem,\nthe most common one is to charge a market-rate fee for each transaction. When\nthere is a surge in demand for a blockchain’s resources, the classical\nsupply-vs-demand market mechanism can ensure that your transaction will go\nthrough in a timely manner if you pay a sufficiently high fee, and also that\nsustained DoS attacks will incur significant costs to the attacker.</p>\n<p>Ethereum evolved this concept of transaction fees even further by introducing\nthe transaction <em>gas</em>, which priced each CPU operation and prevented infinite\nfor-loops and CPU-heavy smart contracts from hogging the blockchain’s resources.\nThe user can choose to pay however much they want in <em>fees</em>, and can also set\nthe <em>gas_limit</em> (i.e. CPU-operations limit) of the transaction. The value of\n<em>fees/gas_limit</em> or <em>gas_price</em> is a bid on each CPU-operation. It is the job of\nthe miner to to pack as many transactions into a block as possible such that\n<em>sum(gas_limit) ≤ block_gas_limit</em>, to maximize fee revenue.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Ethereum chooses to refund a proportion of fees when the\ntransaction does not use all of the gas specified in the <em>gas_limit</em>. This puts\nthe burden of gas-usage prediction on the miner, which may be suboptimal\ncompared to taking all of the fees, and letting the user calculate the expected\n<em>gas_limit</em> themselves.</p>\n<p>Transaction <em>gas</em> is a powerful concept, and can be applied more generally to\nblockchain applications that don’t support an interpreted virtual-machine. For\nexample, the <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/whitepaper#the-hub\">Cosmos Hub</a> can support\ninter-blockchain (IBC) token-transfer transactions from any Tendermint-powered\nsidechain (aka zone), regardless of the number of validators. (Validators are\nnodes that participate in consensus to commit blocks). And yet, the more\nvalidators there are in the zone, the more signatures there will be in the\nblock-hash commit of an IBC transaction. We can solve this with gas such that\ninteroperating with blockchains with larger validator-sets costs more. (Of\ncourse we could also solve this with <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/be29/fa28770bdbbe3d6962d82ab8744658fbfd39.pdf\">cryptographic threshold multi-signature\nalgorithms</a>,\nbut the same concept applies for IBC transactions that require a long\nMerkle-proof).</p>\n<p>Taking the lessons on transaction gas that we’ve learned in implementing the\nEthereum virtual-machine (which got integrated into ErisDB), we’ve implemented a\ntoy cryptocurrency project called\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin\">Basecoin</a> that will become the basis\nfor the Cosmos Hub. Basecoin (not to be confused with the excellent service\n<a href=\"http://coinbase.com/\">Coinbase</a>) is so named because its goal is to become a\nbasis layer for Tendermint-based cryptocurrency applications. It is a\nmulti-asset system at its core, and is intended to accommodate a wide variety of\napplications from simple cryptocurrencies to complex systems like Ethereum.</p>\n<pre><code>// A Basecoin user account\ntype Account struct {\n  PubKey   crypto.PubKey\n  Sequence int\n  Balance  Coins\n}\n\ntype Coin struct {\n  Denom  string // e.g. &quot;BTC&quot;, &quot;ATOM&quot;\n  Amount int64\n}\n\ntype Coins []Coin\n</code></pre>\n<figcaption>Basecoin accounts are natively multi-asset</figcaption>\n<p>Basecoin by default provides the ability to send coins from multiple inputs to\nmultiple outputs with the <em>SendTx</em> transaction. Inputs and outputs are\nEthereum-style accounts (rather than UTXOs), so it’s quite a flexible system.</p>\n<p>But what’s more interesting is the secondary kind of transaction, the <em>AppTx</em> transaction. <em>AppTx</em> transactions are processed by a programmer-provided plugin\nmodule. The interface of a Basecoin plugin can be seen below.</p>\n<pre><code>type Plugin interface {\n    // Name of this plugin, should be short.\n    Name() string\n  \n    // Run a transaction from ABCI DeliverTx\n    RunTx(store KVStore, ctx CallContext, txBytes []byte) (res abci.Result)\n  \n    // Other ABCI message handlers\n    SetOption(store KVStore, key string, value string) (log string)\n    InitChain(store KVStore, vals []*abci.Validator)\n    BeginBlock(store KVStore, height uint64)\n    EndBlock(store KVStore, height uint64) []*abci.Validator\n}\n\ntype CallContext struct {\n    CallerAddress []byte   // Caller's Address (hash of PubKey)\n    CallerAccount *Account // Caller's Account, w/ fee &amp; TxInputs deducted\n    TxInput       Coins    // The coins that the caller wishes to spend, excluding fees\n}\n</code></pre>\n<figcaption>The Basecoin Plugin interface</figcaption>\n<p>The important function is the <em>RunTx</em> interface method, which is what you need\nto implement in order to extend Basecoin with any functionality you want,\nwhether it be IBC coin-transfer, or an EVM smart-contract call. Perhaps you’d\nlike to program an entirely new smart-contract system based on a novel\nvirtual-machine design. The simplicity of the <em>RunTx</em> interface makes it easy to\nget started. Behind the scenes, updates to the <em>KVStore</em> get Merkle-ized and\npersisted to disk automatically. And of course you don’t need to worry about\ncomplicated networking and consensus logic because Tendermint takes care of that\nfor you.</p>\n<p>Basecoin is still a work-in-progress, and it’s (back) in active development. If\nyou feel like hacking Basecoin, check out our <a href=\"http://slack.cosmos.network/\">Slack #basecoin\nchannel</a> and give us a holler!</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>One of the great tragedies of cryptocurrencies has been the failure to\ninteroperate with one another.  Cryptocurrency platforms are competing for\ndominance with their own, largely incompatible technical roadmaps. It’s as if\neach blockchain consensus system with its own community is too sovereign for\nits own good.</p>\n<p>Mechanisms like <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_cross-chain_trading\">atomic swaps</a> between chains can\ncertainly help to link communities. However, where there are no technical\nissues, they often suffer from a need for mature liquidity markets and active\nparticipants on each side. Thus the “altcoin” ecosystem is an alchemical soup\nof enthusiasts experimenting in various ways. Many possess new designs and\nconvictions, yet often each stands alone, siloed by the lack of a general\ninter-blockchain communication system.</p>\n<p>Ethereum sought to address this problem, somewhat indirectly, by inventing a\nnew platform for computation. Ethereum allows arbitrary financial systems to be\nwritten against a common virtual machine using a common development\nenvironment. Presuming all new cryptocurrencies launch on Ethereum, they will\nhave some capacity for interoperability.</p>\n<p>Ethereum is in fact a wonderful idea. Its design decisions are motivated by\nimportant considerations such as the need for a simple specification and\nguaranteed determinism. However, it neglects elements such as the difficulty of\ndesigning a secure general purpose programming environment. This means Ethereum\nhas its own sovereignty problem, as it excludes developers who want access to\nthe platform but want alternatives to the current <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine\">state transition machine</a>.</p>\n<p>Ethereum also doesn’t address the problem of turning fiat currency into\nfungible tokens, short of having banks and government bodies issue currency on\nEthereum itself. While many institutions are investigating the Ethereum\nblockchain, there are both scalability and governance concerns which ultimately\nrestrict full-scale adoption. This may impede integration with existing systems\nand currencies.</p>\n<p>Much like communities, companies and nation-states, each existing\ncryptocurrency is born with the seed of some cultural ideal. Bitcoin is\ndecidedly libertarian, with a slight anarchist leaning. Ethereum is less a\npolitical statement and more an avant-garde academic exercise in distributed\nsystems, computer science and contract theory. Dogecoin is a testament to the\ncapacity for humans to bond over the absurd, a phenomenon more commonly known\nas “being social”. Steem offers a more structured version of this same\nbehavior, with a basis in content production and curation.</p>\n<p>And so on, down the line. But there are many more viewpoints in the world, each\ndoubtlessly wanting a unique experiment in the intersection between governance,\nculture and economics. It would be a tragedy for all these experiments to be so\nrigidly siloed from one another by great chasms of incompatibility.</p>\n<p>Clearly, what is needed is something that can integrate the states of existing\nblockchains. Something that can interface in a sane manner with everything from\nnovelty rewards points to currencies issued by nation-states. Something for\nformalizing relationships between systems, without compromising independence.\nSomething with extreme flexibility without compromising security.</p>\n<p>Enter Cosmos, the “Internet of Blockchains”. Cosmos is a network and a\nframework for interoperability between blockchains. It consists of a web of\nhubs and zones, where each zone is effectively an independent blockchain with\nan arbitrary cryptocurrency design (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZeroCash,\nCryptoNote, your local banking institution, etc.). Each hub is a multi-asset\ncryptocurrency that facilitates interoperability between some set of zones.</p>\n<p>Hubs and zones are powered by the Tendermint Proof-of-Stake (TMSP) consensus\nalgorithm, using the TMSP interface to host applications written in any\nprogramming language. TMSP permits enormous flexibility in application design\nand enables the application to inherit the security features of a\nTendermint-powered blockchain. In fact, Cosmos is compatible with any Byzantine\nFault Tolerant system, which is the basis of Tendermint itself.</p>\n<p>Zones communicate with one another through a hub, primarily in the form of\nasymmetric transfer of some set of tokens from one zone to another.\nEffectively, a hub is a blockchain with many sidechains, but using PoS instead\nof PoW leads to a dramatic reduction in overhead without sacrificing security.\nEach zone acts as a light client for the hub, and the hub acts as a light\nclient for all its zones. Tendermint makes this efficient with compact light\nclient proofs that are secure so long as the validator set is known. This can\nbe achieved by ensuring the light client synchronizes with validator set\nchanges at least as often as they are permitted to occur.</p>\n<p>Cosmos makes no distinction between hubs. There is no top hub and the most\npopular or successful hub is a matter of adoption by zones. Furthermore, there\nis no fundamental distinction between zones and hubs, such that any zone with\nsufficient functionality can become a hub. Cosmos will release one particular\nhub in order to get things started, the aptly named Adam hub. There is nothing\nstopping this hub from becoming obsolete, or stopping the likes of Bitcoin or\nEthereum from competing with it and potentially replacing it.</p>\n<p>Cosmos thus introduces a new kind of market dynamic that formalizes the\nfriction points between various cryptocurrency offerings. It demolishes\nbarriers to interoperability by enabling competition between hubs to contribute\nto the economic security of each hub itself. Validators who misbehave will be\nabandoned for better behaving ones. The result is a heterogeneous network – an\nInternet of Blockchains – adapting for each community and each locale\naccording to its needs, all while retaining a backbone of interoperability. The\ngoal is keeping barriers to entry low while holding stewards of the system\naccountable.</p>\n<p>Cosmos’ potential is building synergy and unlocking the power that exists in\nevery cryptocurrency. As operators in one particular echo chamber of consensus\nsystems design, Cosmos believes interoperability is the key to unlocking the\ncollective developments of this industry. With the Internet of Blockchains,\ncompanies and individuals can utilize the services of one chain, without\nabandoning their existing investments in another. This creates a world that is\nfairer, more functional and better secured. This is a call for an end to echo\nchambers, and the beginning of bridge-building.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>Bitcoin brought the world’s attention to the blockchain. But alas, the Bitcoin\nversion of blockchain isn’t sufficient for the world’s blockchain needs. That\nis because Bitcoin’s proof of work (PoW) consensus <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/bitcoin-could-consume-as-much-electricity-as-denmark-by-2020\">requires an enormous amounts\nof energy</a>. In addition, transactions are painstakingly slow, taking an hour or\nlonger to commit. And because PoW miners have little incentive to be loyal to\none chain or other, upgrades are difficult to coordinate.</p>\n<p>We need an approach to manage blockchains securely that does not impose a huge\nenergy cost on our planet. That approach is Byzantine fault-tolerance\n(BFT)-based <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=27787.0\">proof-of-stake</a> (PoS).  We call it BFT-PoS.</p>\n<p>Before I delve into the merits of BFT-PoS, let me first address the concept of\nByzantine faults without going into confusing detail about <a href=\"http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sschang/OS-Qual/reliability/byzantine.htm\">Lamport’s General\nand his armies</a>.</p>\n<p>In a distributed system, where data is replicated across hundreds or thousands\nof nodes, there needs to be some type of fault-tolerance or consensus\nalgorithm, for the simple fact that computers break down or go offline from\ntime to time. So if a portion of those nodes fail, the system as a whole still\nneeds to reach a consensus.</p>\n<p>Standard fault-tolerant consensus algorithms like\n<a href=\"https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf\">Raft</a> and\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a> assume that\nwhen a node fails, it simply stops working and doesn’t send back a reply.\nGoogle, Facebook, and some existing database products already use this family\nof consensus algorithms within their firewalls to ensure that services remain\navailable despite faulty computers.</p>\n<p>But these algorithms aren’t suitable for public blockchains, because there is\nno firewall in a public blockchain.  Anyone with mining power (in PoW) or\nstaking tokens (in PoS) can participate, or even try to sabotage the network.\nTo reach consensus on a public blockchain, we need Byzantine fault-tolerance.\nIn a Byzantine fault, the faulty node can behave in a completely arbitrary\nmanner. Nodes can even collude to try and maximize the damage they cause.</p>\n<p>So essentially, the purpose of a BFT consensus algorithm is to establish trust\nbetween otherwise unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the\nInternet.</p>\n<p>BFT is nothing new. The concept was first introduced in an academic paper by\n<a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf\">Lamport, Shostak, and Pease in\n1982</a>. But\nLamport et al only demonstrated the theoretical feasibility of the algorithm in\na synchronous environment, where all the messages always arrive on time.</p>\n<p>But in the real world, you can’t really trust the Internet to deliver anything\non time. So in 1988, <a href=\"http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf\">Dwork, Lynch, and Stockmeyer</a> (DLS) proposed an algorithm\nthat works in mostly asynchronous environments.  Later in 1999, <a href=\"http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf\">Miguel Castro\nand Barbara Liskov</a> proposed a practical solution for continuous BFT consensus\nthat was, and still is today, the state-of-the-art in BFT algorithms.</p>\n<p>But for a long time, the mainstream press ignored these seminal works. Nobody\nunderstood the importance of BFT outside academia and major institutions like\nIBM and DARPA, until 2009 when Bitcoin came along. Bitcoin was the first open\ndecentralized application to provide BFT consensus on a global currency ledger,\nbut using a completely novel solution to the Byzantine general’s problem: PoW.</p>\n<p>In PoW, miners compete, based on who has the most processing power, to validate\ntransactions. And for their efforts they are rewarded with transaction fees and\nnewly minted bitcoins. This is how Bitcoin creates new currency.  Bitcoin\nminers around the globe compete in a lottery-like system for these newly issued\nbitcoins, and the efficient market makes it so that the cost of the energy used\nby the global mining network is on the order of the block reward (plus\ntransaction fees).  Today, that turns out to be around $1M worth of electricity\nper day.  In addition, Bitcoin mining is being commoditized by <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1072474.0\">large data\ncenters in places of the world where electricity is more affordable</a>, making it\ndifficult for laymen to participate.</p>\n<p>PoS, on the other hand, does away with the energy dependence of PoW entirely.\nIn PoS, miners are replaced with “validators” who have a stake in the system.\nValidators don’t have to invest in expensive processing systems but they do\nhave to purchase “staking tokens.” Any normal laptop will suffice to solve the\nalgorithm.</p>\n<p>Peercoin, <a href=\"https://bitshares.org/\">BitShares</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nxt\">Nxt</a>, and others already use some form of\nPoS, and Ethereum is planning a move to PoS in the near future. Yet, while PoS\nmakes practical sense, many people have <a href=\"https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf\">rallied against the use of\nPoS</a>, claiming it is\nimpossible to secure. But that is simply not true. Using BFT, you absolutely\ncan secure PoS.  It’s just that we haven’t seen any BFT-PoS public blockchains\nyet.</p>\n<p>While the theory may be difficult to explain or understand, the ultimate\nresults provided by proper BFT algorithms are simple to grasp.  Unlike PoW\nblockchains, BFT-PoS blockchains do not fork (i.e. get double-spend attacked)\nat all unless ⅓ or more validators coordinate such an attack.  And, when 1/3 or\nmore validators do cause a double-spend attack, we can computationally\ndetermine which validators were responsible for the attack, destroy their\nstaking tokens and eject them from the network.  It’s as if the staking tokens\nare virtualized PoW miners that blow up when used to attack the system.  No\nother blockchain consensus algorithm, including PoW, can provide the level of\ncollateralization that is possible with BFT-PoS.</p>\n<p>BFT-PoS performs extremely well. Today, in global public blockchain with a few\nhundred validators, you can get transaction finality on the  order of 3\nseconds, easily – no need to wait for additional block confirmations! The\ntheory has proven to us that these are optimal fault-tolerance thresholds for\n“instant-finality” blockchains.  While more validators does slow down\nconsensus, if <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/\">Nielsen’s\nlaw</a> continues to hold,\nwe’ll even be able to support an exponentially increasing number of validators\nevery year with the same performance.</p>\n<p>In addition, BFT-PoS will also increase the security of mobile wallets. Few of\nthe mobile wallets in existence today take full advantage of the security\noffered by Bitcoin, for the simple fact that nobody is willing to wait an hour\nfor a transaction to clear. Instead, most wallets just assume that <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/peter-todd-explains-the-problems-with-unconfirmed-bitcoin-transactions\">the person\nsending the money isn’t trying to double spend\nit</a>.\nAnd, though we don’t have time to dive into it here, efficient mobile wallet\nprotocols, or “light client SPV” protocols are the key to future blockchain\ninteroperability.</p>\n<p>While PoW worked well for Bitcoin, it’s costly, slow, and environmentally\nunfriendly. The best alternative out there right now is BFT-PoS. It’s an\nenduring, energy efficient solution that works well in asynchronous\nenvironments. And best of all, because BFT was developed by the best and the\nbrightest in the computer science industry, it’s provably secure. You can’t do\nany better than that.</p>\n",

TMSP를 통해 엄청난 자유도의 어플리케이션 설계가 가능하며, 어플리케이션이 텐더민트 기반 블록체인의 보안적 특성(security features of a Tendermint-powered blockchain)도 활용할 수 있도록 한다.</p>\n<p>존(zone)들은 허브(hub)를 통해 서로 소통하는데, 주로 각 존들이 서로 한 묶음의 토큰(some set of tokens)을 비대칭 전송(asymetric transfer)함으로 그렇게 한다. 사실상, 허브는 다수의 <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf\">사이드체인</a>을 가진 단일한 블록체인이라고 정의할 수 있고, PoW대신 PoS(Proof-of-Stake, 지분증명)방식을 사용하기 때문에 보안성을 유지하면서도 간접비용(채굴비용)은 획기적으로 절감한다. 방법론적으로는 각 존은 허브를 위한 라이트 클라이언트(light client) 역할을 하며, 마찬가지로 허브도 존들의 라이트 클라이언트 역할을 하는 것이다. 텐더민트는 ‘<a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Light-Client-Protocol\">컴팩트 라이트 클라이언트 증명(compact light client proofs)</a>’을 통해 효율적으로 이 역할을 수행하는데, 가장 최근의 정확한 발리데이터 세트(validator set)가 알려져 있는 상태에서, 발리데이터 세트 내용이 변경될 때마다, 라이트 클라이언트가 이를 <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/\">동기화</a>함으로 보안성을 확보하는 것이다.</p>\n<p>많은 사람들이 지분증명(PoS)을 안전하지 않은 방식이라며 <a href=\"https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf\">반대</a>하고 있다. 하지만 동시에, 단일한 PoW체인을 통해 복수의 PoS체인들의 보안성을 획득하는 것도 큰 의미가 없음을 인정한다. 텐더민트 개발자인 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/738550345597648896\">Ethan Buchman</a>은 궁극적으로 PoW체인은 하나여야만 하고, 반면에 PoS는 각 암호화폐, 보상시스템, 또는 존재하는 다양한 토큰들 기반 시스템에 맞추어 수천, 수백만개가 되어야 한다고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>코스모스(Cosmos) 위에서 각 허브들은 동등한 지위를 가진다. 최상위 허브(top hub)와 같은 개념은 존재하지 않으며, 허브의 성공이나 명성은 얼마나 많은 존(zone)들에게 선택받느냐에 달려있다. 엄밀히 말하면, 존(zone)과 허브(hub)도 근본적인 차이는 없다. 어느 존이든 충분한 기능을 갖춘다면, 허브가 될 수 있다. 우선은 생태계를 조성하기 위해 텐더민트에서 자체적으로 허브(Adam hub, 아담허브)를 런칭할 것이지만, 언제든지 다른 허브가 등장할 수 있으며, 비트코인이나 이더리움 같은 허브이든, 아니면 그 자체이든 얼마든지 아담과 경쟁하고 아담을 대체할 수 있다.</p>\n<p>코스모스(Cosmos)은 다양한 암호화폐들 간의 장벽을 해소하고 새로운 역학관계를 만들어낼 것이다. 또한 허브들 간의 경쟁을 촉진하고 경제적인 안정을 도모하도록 유도한다. 부정행위를 하고자 하는 발리데이터(Validator, 유효성 검사자: 비트코인의 채굴자과 유사한 역할-합의구조 유지)들은 시스템 안정성에 기여하는 다른 발리데이터에 의해 대체될 것이다. 결과적으로는, 다양한 네트워크들이 코스모스 위에서 공존할 것이고, 각 필요에 따른 커뮤니티와 필요에 따른 공간이 개별적으로 존재하면서도 동시에 근간이 되는 시스템에서 이들 간의 상호운용(interoperability)이 가능하도록 만들 것이다. 이러한 특성을 통해 접근성을 높이면서 시스템 안정성과 서비스의 질도 함께 높이게 될 것이다.</p>\n<p>새로운 암호화폐를 위한 ‘시험장’으로써든, 기존 암호화폐를 ‘개선’시키기 위해서든 또는 ‘탈중앙화된 거래소’나 확장성이 보장된 ‘스마트컨트랙트를 위한 플랫폼’으로써 사용하든 ‘코스모스(Cosmos)’의 잠재력은 곧, 존재하는 모든 암호화폐들의 잠재력이며, 시너지를 통해 더 큰 잠재력을 발휘할 수 있다. 정말 필요한 질문은, ‘과연 당신은 여기에 무엇을 만들 것인가’이다.</p>\n",
