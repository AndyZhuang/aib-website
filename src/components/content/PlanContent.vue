  <h1>Crowdfund Plan</h1>

  <p>
    <i>LAST UPDATED: Aug 29th, 2016</i><br/><br/>
    Weâ€™ve decided to crowdfund our project to raise funds to allow us to
    continue working on the Cosmos hub. Right now, we have already developed
    <a href="http://tendermint.com/">Tendermint</a>, the proof-of-state
    algorithm that will power the blockchain.  And we have all the specs in
    place for how Cosmos will work. But in order to go further, we need to
    raise capital. Here are the plans for our crowdfund campaign that will
    start on October 17, 2016 and go for 42 days.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>
        Cosmos Foundation is a non-profit Canadian entity. Its mission is to
        create, maintain, and further develop, the Cosmos ecosystem.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Cosmos Foundation will hold a crowdfunding campaign to sell tokens,
        called <i>atoms</i>, that give the holder limited license to use the Cosmos hub.
        Proceeds will go to the Cosmos Foundation to develop the essential Cosmos
        software and services.
    </p></li>
    <li>There will be 20,000,000 atoms on Genesis day. On Genesis day, the
      distribution of atoms will be split between:
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-funders (5%)</li>
        <li>Cosmos Foundation (20%)</li>
        <li>Crowdfund Funders (75%)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>
        Upon completion of the crowdfund, all the atom holders, including Cosmos
        Foundation, will play the Delegation Game in a special purpose Ethereum
        smart contract (which holds no ether). The top 100 validators after
        delegation will be chosen as validators for the genesis block, which will
        be the first block in the Cosmos blockchain. 
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Everyone&#39;s atoms will vest over a period of two years after Genesis.
        Unvested atoms cannot be transferred until vested.  Unvested atoms will
        vest over time, at a rate of 1/(24x365x2) of the account&#39;s atoms,
        every hour.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Every validator must participate in governance, or else become
        inactivated and eventually unbonded. Delegators who delegate atoms to
        such validators likewise will also get their delegated atoms inactivated
        and eventually unbonded.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Anyone may receive more atoms by passing a governance proposal with an
        attached award. Such reward atoms will be purely inflationary.  
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        One third of the total number of atoms will be distributed back to the
        bonded atom holders for having a stake in consensus. This is a tax
        (disincentive) for not putting atoms at stake, and not participating in
        governance during the first two years after genesis.
    </p></li>
  </ul>

  <!-- FUNDING ------------------------------------------------------>

  <h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
  <p>Cosmos Foundation is raising funds in two phases.</p>

  <h3 id="phase-0-the-prefund">Phase 0: Prefund (completed August 4, 2016)</h3>
  <p>
    During the prefund, 5% of future genesis atoms were sold to a qualified
    investor with a cap and/or discount. The proceeds from this early investor
    are being used to prepare for and execute the crowdfund, as well as to pay
    for legal expenses.
  </p>

  <h3 id="phase-1-the-crowdfund">Phase 1: Crowdfund (to start October 17, 2016)</h3>
  <p>
    During the crowdfund, 75% of future genesis atoms will be sold to members
    of the public who wish to support or participate in this project. The
    crowdfund will happen over a period of 42 days, similar to the Ethereum
    crowdfund.
  </p>
  <p>
    The crowdfund will be uncapped for the first 24 hours, but then capped at
    $9M equivalent of bitcoins after the first 24 hours. After 24 hours since
    the beginning of the crowdfund, when the total amount raised exceeds $9M
    given the price of bitcoin at 9am PDT the morning of, or after 42 days,
    whichever comes first, the crowdfund will immediately stop.
  </p>

  <h3 id="funding-milestones">Funding Milestones</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the crowdfund does not meet the minimum $3M -- the funds will be returned</li>
    <li>If the crowdfund exceeds $3M -- Essential Cosmos Software</li>
    <li>If the crowdfund exceeds $5M -- Ethereum peg</li>
    <li>If the crowdfund exceeds $7M -- Bitcoin peg</li>
    <li>If the crowdfund exceeds $8M -- Open-source hardware wallet (sold separately)</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- DEFINITIONS ------------------------------------------------------>

  <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
  <p><strong>Cosmos Ecosystem</strong>:
    The Cosmos network and supporting software and services, including
    validator and client software.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Cosmos Foundation</strong>:
    A non-profit Canadian legal entity that manages the crowdfund and genesis
    of the Cosmos hub. Besides the initial development of the essential
    Cosmos software and services, Cosmos Foundation. has no further
    obligations with regards to the Cosmos ecosystem, Cosmos hub, or
    derivatives (forks) of the Cosmos hub, but instead is a general
    participant in the network.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Cosmos Hub</strong>:
    A blockchain, or zone, that connects to many other zones. The hub
    facilitates token movement between zones. The Cosmos hub will be the
    first hub, and the first zone.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Cosmos Hub Block Reward</strong>:
    The blockchain will reward the validators and delegators in proportion to
    their bonded atoms, and afterwards account for any commissions that
    delegators pay to delegate validators. The reward will consist of
    transaction fees and inflationary atoms. Transaction fees include any fee
    collected by a validator. In addition, there will be inflationary atoms
    at a rate of 1/3 of the total number of atoms per year. (At genesis,
    there will be 20M atoms, one year later 20M x 1.3333, and so on.) Cosmos
    holders who do not put their atoms at stake by being a validator or
    delegating to a validator will not receive any of the Cosmos hub block
    rewards.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Cosmos Network</strong>:
    The Cosmos hub and all the zones (blockchains) that connect to it.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Crowdfund</strong>:
    An atom token crowdfund event that happens during a period of 42 days. A
    website will be made available where anyone who wants to purchase atoms
    can sign up prior to the crowdfund. Proceeds will go toward funding the
    essential Cosmos software and services, starting with the public release
    of Tendermint Core.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Delegator</strong>:
    An atom holder who puts his/her atoms at stake by delegating its
    validating power and voting power to a validator. A delegator is still
    responsible for voting on proposals during the vesting period. If a
    delegator does not vote, he/she will not be penalized, but he/she will
    inherit the vote of the delegated validator.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Early Funders</strong>:
    Qualified investors who purchased 5% of the genesis atoms prior to the
    crowdfund. The majority of the proceeds from the early funding will go
    toward legal and PR fees, and also help pay salary for Cosmos Foundation
    employees until the crowdfund is complete.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Validator</strong>:
    Full nodes of a Cosmos zone responsible for committing blocks in that
    zone. The Cosmos hub start with 100 validator spots. Due to the limited
    number of validator spots, not everyone who has atoms can be a validator.
    Instead, everyone else can bond atoms and delegate their consensus voting
    power to any of the 100 validators. Before genesis, the Cosmos crowdfund
    funders will play the Delegation Game to determine the top 100 bonded
    delegates who will become the genesis validators.
