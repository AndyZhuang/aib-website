## Blogging

Create and edit posts with Markdown in the `./src/posts/` directory.

Be sure to include YAML meta data for each Markdown file. Here's an example post:

    ---
    title: Just a Test
    date: 2016-04-04
    author: Peng Zhong
    ---

    Here is some markdown data. This is **just** a *test*.

    * One
    * Two
    * Three

    1. Four
    2. Five
    3. Six

Build the blog only with `npm run blog`, or everything with `npm run build`.
