### Fundraiser date moved to April 6, 6am PDT

Many of you have been asking us for more information and updates. The date we
announced for our fundraiser is almost here and everybody wants to inspect the
terms and conditions and look under the hood before embarking on this adventure
of cosmic proportions.

Well today, we finally answer your calling with several critical updates:

### Limitations on US Funders and Elsewhere

One of the most frequent questions we have received was whether US persons can
participate in the fundraiser. After all, there is no reason to think that the
proportion of potential Cosmonauts in the land of the free would be any lower
than elsewhere. It would be easy to block US persons and call it a day, but
this isn’t a satisfying solution.  So, we spent a lot of time with our lawyers
to analyze the situation.

After a series of meetings last week, we’ve finally come to a decision -- we’re
lifting the general ban on US residents and citizens!  We’re super excited
about this outcome, and hope you are too.

We reserve the right to block contributions from certain few states within the
US as we discover more about state-level regulations.  The state of Washington
& New Hampshire are top on the list of states we want to block.  We will
finalize any such decisions by Wednesday the 29th.

We will still take care to block certain countries on the OFAC sanctions list.
The full list is [here](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx).

### Fundraiser Instructions

The flow of our fundraiser has also been finished and is with our security
auditors, Smart Contract Solutions, for a final review.  They are among the
most experienced companies when it comes to the security of cryptocurrency
fundraisers and have done past security audits of Golem, DFINITY, ether.camp
and WeTrust. We will be publishing the full fundraiser flow with instructions
on Wednesday, and Smart Contract Solutions will also be publishing their
security review of the process.

We got our first review results from Smart Contract Solutions just over a week
ago.  No severe security issues were found, but we did get some great
recommendations, so we decided to implement a few improvements.  Not only is our
new fundraiser flow now more secure, it’s also much easier to follow.  All you
need to do is write down and remember 12 words -- and you can even generate
these words on an offline computer.

We’re very happy with this new flow and believe that it’s worth the wait, so
please bear with us while we do a final round of audits.

### Fundraiser Contributor Terms

We are also releasing the Cosmos Contribution Terms for the fundraiser. This is
a comprehensive document that outlines the risks, rights and obligations of the
fundraiser. Anybody planning to participate in the fundraiser needs to
carefully review the document. And please let us know if you have any questions
or comments.

If we make any further modifications to these terms, we will post a separate
blog post about the updates, so be sure to check our website prior to the
fundraiser.

### Pre-Fund Amounts

This journey started quite a long time ago, and without the support of some
early, irreverent Cosmonauts, we wouldn’t be here today. Thus, the foundation
will recommend allocating a corresponding amount of atoms to those funders.

First, we received a commitment for USD $300,000 from lead donors in August
2016. At that time, we didn’t know much about what the Cosmos fundraiser would
look like, so we recommended that those early donors be allocated 5% of the total
atom supply for their support.

Second, we received a number of contributions from pre-contributors and
strategic partners. Those are also people who supported the project
substantially earlier and/or are providing crucial support in other areas. We
raised a total of USD $1,329,472 from these 13 individuals and entities. We did
give discounts between 15% and 25% on these contributions. The total amount of
atoms allocated to pre-contributors and strategic partners is 16,856,718.

### Bug Bounty Program Winners!

We are happy to announce the three winners of our bug bounty program. They are
the ones who dug into the code to find the weaknesses in our fundraiser flows.
The winners are: 

 - **Denis Milicevic** - for pointing out an issue in our Solidity code for emergency
ETH return addresses.  Thank you Denis, please accept our bounty for 3 bitcoins
worth of atoms.

 - **Piotr** - for independently finding the above issue, but also identifying a
non-critical bug wherein the smart contract cannot be killed after being
halted.  Thank you Piotr, we’d like to grant you 3 bitcoins or 3 bitcoins’
worth of atoms.

 - **Christopher Goes** - for identifying a UX error in the web wallet backup flow
where we show both a failure and success notification when the wallet backup
fails for whatever reason.  Thank you Christopher!  We’ve already credited
Christopher with 3 bitcoins.

When we release the new fundraiser flow on Wednesday, we look forward to
another round of public review from the community.  Thank you for your support!

### Fundraiser Date

The date we had announced for our fundraiser was this Friday, March 31. We
would be able to go ahead with this date, but we don’t feel we have given all
of you enough time to review the terms, familiarize yourselves with the
fundraising structure and ask your questions. Additionally, the new and
improved fundraiser flow needs a new round of review.  For this reason, we
decided to push back the date of the fundraiser by six days to Thursday April
6th, 6am Pacific Time.

Here are a few other things coming up in the next days:

 - **Tuesday 3/28** - AmA with Cryptocopia community at 3pm EDT (Slack: cryptocopia.slack.com)
 - **Wednesday 3/29** - AmA with CoinFund community at 3pm EDT (Slack: coinfund.slack.com)
 - **Wednesday 3/29** - Publication of fundraiser flow and instructions
 - **Thursday 3/30** - Completion of second security audit
 - **Friday 3/31** - Publication of Cosmos Constitution
 - **Thursday 4/6** - Cosmos Fundraiser begins!

We hope you are as excited as we are to get to the end of this long road, to
start an even longer cosmos journey.
