### Fundraiser date moved to April 31, 6am PDT

Due to a variety of cosmic, terrestrial, and digital constraints,
we are postponing the fundraiser to April 31. We did not come to this decision
lightly, and we appreciate your patience as we work out the critical components
of a successful fundraiser.

### Limitations on Funders Location

After further regulatory analysis we have concluded that only residents of the following
geographic locales may participate in the fundraiser:

- Macquarie Island, Australia
- Svalbard, Norway
- Barrow, Alaska
- Motuo, China
- Alert, Nunavut, Canada
- La Rinconada, Peru
- Easter Island
- Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland
- Kerguelen Islands, South Indian Ocean
- Pitcairn Island, South Pacific
- Bouvet Island
- McMurdo, Antarctica
- Supai, Arizona
- Koryak Okrug, Siberia
- Socotra Island
- Area 51, Nevada

We are quite confident these regions amply cover the distribution of interested participants,
and are thrilled that both human and extraterestrial residents of the US will be able to participate.

### Fundraiser Instructions

We have made important updates to the Fundraiser flow. After considerable 
negative analysis as to the security of the javascript programming language,
we have decided that the only secure way to conduct the fundaraiser is via bullion bars
delivered by carrier pigeon or eagle. We will be accepting Gold, Silver, and Ytterbium,
at a fixed rate to be announced closer to the date.

### Conclusion

We hope you are as excited as we are to get to the end of this long road, to
start an even longer cosmos journey!
