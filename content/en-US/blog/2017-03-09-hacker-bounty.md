_UPDATE: The ETH Solidity contract has been updated_

Ladies and gentlemen, a small appeal to the most scrutinizing eyeballs of our industry.

Cosmos hasn’t been called ‘Tinder for blockchains’ for no reason. Connecting different blockchains is at the core of our mission. When it came to choosing how to conduct our fundraiser, we naturally chose to accept both BTC and ETH.

Keeping the fundraiser safe for all parties is critical and dealing with both tokens adds additional surface area for attacks and potential issues. That is why we are extending, as of today, ample rewards for anyone with both the time and skills to really dig into our flows.

We are offering:

* Exactly **15 BTC** for major, show-stopping bugs found in our fundraiser flow.
* Up to **5 BTC** for minor bugs that won't kill the fundraiser, but which will be an embarrassment or an inconvenience for either Cosmos or its funders.
* You can also claim your reward in Atoms.

The materials in question can be found here:

* BTC: https://gist.github.com/mappum/428dc46afba73b2bf8c38f65272704d2
* ETH: https://github.com/cosmos/fundraiser-lib/blob/afdef65dabc4c058ac6fde73dc44dccfcafd428d/contracts/Receiptor.sol

These repositories include both the Web-based fundraiser for Bitcoin, and the Solidity contracts for Ethereum. Both are relevant to this bounty. So this is your chance to put your hacker cap on, think like a deviant and strike it big in the crypto space.

In the interest of being thorough, our friends at Zeppelin (Smart Contract Solutions) are simultaneously performing an audit for these same materials. Don’t worry, if you independently discover a bug that they also find but haven’t published yet, you may still claim the reward.

Last but not least, we want to express our thanks to participants in the [Cosmos Whitepaper Bounty](./cosmos-whitepaper-bounty), particularly GitHub user MartyMe, who took the 5 BTC bounty with his excellent contributions to both the DEX and the Hub Block Reward.

This show is nearly on the road, with just a few more miles to go. We look forward to a successful fundraiser, and to building the Internet of Blockchains with you!
