Last week, we said that if we make any further modifications
to the Penultimate Draft Cosmos Contribution Terms, we would
post a separate blog about the update.  Here is that update.

* [Cosmos Contribution Terms FINAL](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/raw/master/fundraiser/Interchain%20Cosmos%20Contribution%20Terms%20-%20FINAL.pdf)
* [Cosmos Contribution Terms FINAL - REDLINE](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/raw/master/fundraiser/Interchain%20Cosmos%20Contribution%20Terms%20-%20FINAL%20-%20REDLINE.docx)

No significant changes have been made.

* We explicitly block the state of Washington and New Hampshire from the United States.
* We make note of expected administrative fees for internal tax purposes.
* We set the inflation rate to target 2/3 bonded, rather than 1/2.
* We clarify that the USD $10,000,000.00 cap includes the earlier contributions.
