We have very exciting news: We are launching the Cosmos fundraiser on [March 31st, at 6am PDT](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=5391959,2657908,2643743,1835848&h=5391959&date=2017-3-31&sln=6-7). We'd like to thank everybody for being patient with us! We still have work to do before then, and are planning on releasing the following before the fundraiser starts:

* All fundraiser agreement terms
* Instructions for people who are interested in participating
* Information about early contributors
* Our procedure for completing (and shutting down) the fundraiser flow.

This date is dependent on not finding any show-stopping bugs in the fundraiser flow, and we are still [offering bounties](./fundraiser-flow-bounty) for anybody who helps us find issues!
