A lot of people have been asking us how many atoms will be created and how they
will be distributed. So we thought it would be useful to give an overview and
run through a few different scenarios that show what happens at different
levels of funding.

#### Scenario 1: USD $10.2m Raised in 3 Days  
If we stay below the USD $10m mark in the first 6 hours, the fundraiser will
continue. In that case, we might hit the cap after a few days and then end the
fundraiser process. Ending the fundraising process won't be immediate. Some
people will be the middle of the contribution process and they will still be
able to get their contribution in. So we will overshoot the cap somewhat.

Here is what the total atom supply and distribution could look like in that
scenario:

| Category                              | Amount Raised       | Atoms Allocated |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Early Donors                          | USD $300,000        | 6,837,467       |
| Strategic Partners & Pre-Contributors | USD $1,329,472      | 16,856,718      |
| Fundraiser Participants               | USD $8,570,528      | 85,705,280      |
| Interchain Foundation                 |                     | 13,674,933      |
| All in Bits                           |                     | 13,674,933      |
| **Total**                             | **USD $10,200,000** | **136,749,331** |

#### Scenario 2: USD $12.5m Raised in 6 Hours  
If a lot of people want to participate in the fundraiser, we could go above the
USD $10m mark in the first six hours. In case it went very high, we would end
the fundraiser early, even before the six hours are up. But if the amount
raised exceeds the USD $10m cap by a few million, then we will let it run until
the six hours are up and end it then.

Here is what the total supply and distribution of tokens could look like in
that scenario:

| Category                              | Amount Raised       | Atoms Allocated |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Early Donors                          | USD $300,000        | 8,370,800       |
| Strategic Partners & Pre-Contributors | USD $1,329,472      | 16,856,718      |
| Fundraiser Participants               | USD $10,870,528     | 108,705,280     |
| Interchain Foundation                 |                     | 16,741,600      |
| All in Bits                           |                     | 16,741,600      |
| **Total**                             | **USD $12,500,000** | **167,415,997** |

#### Scenario 3: USD $7.2m Raised in 2 Weeks  
It's also perfectly possible that fewer people want to become cosmonauts and
that we won't reach the USD $10m cap at all. In that case, we will let the
fundraiser run for two weeks before it ends.

Here is what the total supply and distribution of tokens could look like in a
scenario like that:

| Category                              | Amount Raised       | Atoms Allocated |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Early Donors                          | USD $300,000        | 4,837,467       |
| Strategic Partners & Pre-Contributors | USD $1,329,472      | 16,856,718      |
| Fundraiser Participants               | USD $5,570,528      | 55,705,280      |
| Interchain Foundation                 |                     | 9,674,933       |
| All in Bits                           |                     | 9,674,933       |
| **Total**                             | **USD $7,200,000**  | **96,749,331**  |

We hope that will answer some of your questions and give you a better idea of
how many atoms will be created under different scenarios. The atom rate that we
will recommend for the allocation of fundraiser participants will always be 1.0
atom per USD $0.10 contributed. The more we raise the smaller the percentage of
the total atom supply that 1.0 atom will represent. But then again, the more
resources we have to build out the Cosmos Network and make sure it is capable
of great cosmic adventures.
