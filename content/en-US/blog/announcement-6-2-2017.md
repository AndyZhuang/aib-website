Dear backers and long term supporters,

Although February 28th was the most recently cited launch date for our Cosmos
fundraising event, after careful consideration we've decided to push this event
back a bit further. For the time being, _no new date_ has been set, but we are
hopeful that we are delayed by less than a single month. Here is why:

1. After communicating with many of our most committed funders, we have decided
   to accept both Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). This is a trickier matter than
   it may seem to be on the surface. In order to do it securely, we _must_
   perform audits on our fundraiser code, fixing any issues that we find. At
   the moment we don't know exactly how long this will take. The initial flow
   will be finalized by Monday next week (Feb 13th), and promptly delivered to
   auditors. Soon after, we'll make the code available for public review, and
   provide bounties for anybody who discovers issues.

2. We _must_ finalize the Cosmos roadmap. In order to finalize the roadmap, we
   are concluding negotiations with interested parties and reviewing financial
   details regarding the core Cosmos software. These details should be released
   by Thursday (Feb 9th) for public review.

3. We've updated our whitepaper and will be seeking feedback over the coming
   days. As with the fundraiser code, we are going to post bounties for the
   best feedback/contributions to the whitepaper. This will be announced
   formally in short order, but if anyone wants to get a head start, the
   current whitepaper is available at
   https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md. Details about
   the bounty system will likewise be posted soon at
   https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/BOUNTY.md.

Some time has passed since we first announced that we are doing the fundraiser.
I really appreciate everyone who continues to stick with us while we work all
the details out. The decision to delay was made after careful consideration; we
really want to be absolutely sure everything is going to be as secure as
possible, leading (hopefully) to a very awesome and successful fundraiser.

We will announce the new date for the fundraiser two weeks before it goes live.

Thanks again to everyone who has followed and supported our work; this is going
to be a great year!
